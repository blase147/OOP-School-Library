## 📖 OOP-School-Library<a name="about-project"></a>

In this project, I achieved the following

- Created a class Corrector with a method correct_name.
- Set an instance of Corrector in Person on initialization.
- In Person, added a method validate_name that uses the Corrector instance to validate and save the corrected name(after trimming name).
